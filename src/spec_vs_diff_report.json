  "summary": "Diff shows a camera-first launch state in App.tsx (activeWindow defaults to 'camera' after intro) and adds unauthenticated-safe gating/toasts in CameraView for capture/record actions. However, evidence is insufficient/absent in the provided diff excerpts to confirm the required full-screen/no-chrome camera shell behavior and the non-blocking auth prompt with explicit Sign-in and Continue-as-Guest actions on the camera screen.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Camera is the default starting view for all users and renders as a full-screen “big camera” experience (no header/sidebar/container padding) immediately after intro splash completes.",
      "reason": "App.tsx shows default activeWindow='camera' and an intro completion handler, but the diff excerpt does not show conditional layout logic that removes header/sidebar/padded container for the camera view (\"no app shell chrome\" / \"not inside padded container\").",

      "requirement": "Remove automatic redirect to Login on startup; keep logged-out users on full-screen Camera and show a clear, non-blocking auth prompt on the camera with actions to Sign in (Internet Identity) or Continue as Guest.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not show the previous redirect removal nor the camera auth prompt UI with both required actions. CameraView has props for onLogin/onGuestMode but the provided excerpt does not show a rendered overlay/button group for those actions.",
